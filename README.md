# Writing-on-files-App
This application will generate Random numbers and write them to a file.  The form will also include the usual Reset and Close Buttons.   User input is very important to this application.  The user will specify the range of numbers to be generated via a TextBox for the start of range and another for the end of the range (inclusive).  In another TextBox, the user will specify the quantity of numbers they want in their file (i.e. how many will the Random number generator make).  For example, the user might decide to have a range of numbers from 12 to 63, and they want 3,091 of them.  The user will then click the ‘Generate/Save’ button which will, via a SaveFileDialog control, ask the user for a file name and location to save the file with the numbers. The SaveFileDialog control should start the user in their ‘C:\’ drive, and should be pre-filtered to only show files with a txt (*.txt) file extension.   The saved file will include two columns – the first is a sequential series of numbers to count by and the second column is the Random number generated.  For example, if the user chose 5 numbers with a range of 11-19.
